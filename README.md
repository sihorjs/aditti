## Running of application

-   `npm start` - launch client and server part of app in one terminal (now only in dev mode).
-   `npm run start:frontend` - run frontend application, using `webpack-dev-server` on port `7000`.
-   `npm run start:server` - run `express` server on port `3000`.
-   `npm test` - run `jest` tests.

## Code style

Rules of code style for JavaScript are described in `.eslintrc`. To format code all code I use `prettier`; settings are available in `.prettierrc`.
